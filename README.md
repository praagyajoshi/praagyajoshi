### Hi there 👋

I'm Praagya, an engineering lead with a full stack development background.  
I've built products and led teams for companies at diverse stages:
- hyper growth unicorn SaaS 🦄
- early to mid stage food tech 🍔
- early stage health tech 🏃‍♂️

Right now, I'm leading the Growth Engineering team at [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/)
- making onboarding as smooth as possible
- focusing on user activation and plan upgrade/checkout experience
- PLG (product led growth)
